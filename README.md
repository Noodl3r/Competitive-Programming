# Competitive Programming Solution Set

This repo details problems and solutions across both the [Euler Project](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [Code Forces](https://codeforces.com/).

## Notes

- Most solutions are written in Python
- As per the [Project Euler Rules](https://projecteuler.net/about), only solutions to the first 100 problems will be included here.
- As per the [Codeforce Rules](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/4088), solutions will only be posted following contests.

## Why this exists

As a Physics student I've primarily used Python and CPP for data analytics or embedded systems programming. This type of "competitive programming" is entirely unique compared to these fields. Through this practice I hope to

- Sharpen algorithmic thinking
- Track progress over times
- Share approaches and ideas with others

Feel free to suggest improvements or leave any other comments.
